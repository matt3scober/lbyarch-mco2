Write the kernel in (1) C program and (2) an x86-64 assembly language.  
The kernel is to perform DAXPY (A*X + Y) function.

Input: Scalar variable n (integer) contains the length of the vector;  
Scalar variable A is a double-precision float. Vectors X, Y and Z are double-precision float.

*Required to use functional scalar SIMD registers

*Required to use functional scalar SIMD floating-point instructions

Process:  
Example:

A --> 2.0

x -> 1.0, 2.0, 3.0

y -> 11.0, 12.0, 13.0

(answer) z--> 13.0, 16.0, 19.0

Output: store result in vector Z.  
Display the result of 1st ten elements of vector Z for all versions of kernel (i.e., C and x86-64).
